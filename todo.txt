- check EbMSMessageContentValidationFilter and EbMSMessageDataValidationFilter and EbMSMessageContentXSDValidationFilter
- implement EbMSSyncReplyValidationFilter in EbMSMessageHeaderValidationFilter???
- If CPAId is not recognized, a response is generated:
	- Error - NotRecognized (use CPAExistsFilter!!!)
	- normally get errorURI from CPA
	- now get errorURI from From element???
- generate DeliveryFailure if actor=nextMSH???
- store url (and signMessage???) in ebms_send_event
- Message Responses:
	- validate received error and acknowledgment messages
	- add duplicate elimination???
- implement MSH Ping and MessageStatus Services in EbMSAdapter Interface
	- make EbMS Ping and MessageStatus Services async
	- store Ping/Pong and MessageStatus Request and Response messages in the database???
	- add duplicate elimination???
- handle SOAP Faults???
	- store
	- end retry
- check if duplicateElimination behaves according to specs (when duplicate message (=messageId) is sent with different content or signature)
	- remove EbMSMessageHeaderCompareFilter (not according to EbMS specs) or make it configurable???
	- check order: security check, duplicate elimination, header check?

- validate Reference element if present in Aknowledgement against original message???
- collect list of errors in message validators (instead of exit on the first error)???
- check CPA for invalid use of urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-msg:service namespace for defined services???
- notify From Party somehow on delivery failure (after all retries have failed)???

2.1.x:
- create documentation/manual
- improve error handling and logging
- improve validation of received Error and Acknowledgment messages
- configure CPA caching (or load CPA once per message)?
- get hostname (needed for messageId) from CPA

2.2.x:
/ implement Ping Service
/ implement MessageStatus Service
- implement MessageOrder
- implement syncReplyMode?
- implement ackRequested (mode=never)
- implement duplicateElimination (mode=never)
- implement Encoding?
- implement JMS Client interface?
- implement dynamic cxf outbound endpoints (request url has to be resolved from CPA)?

3.x.x:
- update adapter to Mule 3
- support additional protocols besides http(s), like mail, file, etc?
- store http response status code with ebms send event

considerations:
- change wsdl definition to one operation (containing all ebxml elements) and 'parse' message in Mule?
- replace cxf interface?
